ReScript is a modern and statically typed programming language that compiles to JavaScript. It is a Meta-Language-descendant and thus almost everything is an expression. This makes it possible to write idioms like <code>switch await &lt;myResultPromise&gt;</code> which is not possible in plain JavaScript, since switch is a statement there and pattern-matching is still not available.</p>\n<p>I use this language as a daily driver at work since it exists (2020) and I, among many others, help make it better every day by contributing to documentation or standard library, fixing editor tooling or compiler bugs or just by writing more blog articles like this one.</p>\n<p>As you can imagine, this very website is also powered by ReScript, so I just have to give a shoutout to <a href=\"bloodyowl.io\">bloodyowl.io</a> for creating the very down-to-earth <code>rescript-pages</code> static site generator.</p>\n"}
